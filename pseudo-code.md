Building a fitness tracker app

Need a user model with name, password, email. All required

Need to be able to add an exercise. A string for the name, number for the sets, number for the reps, string for the unit of measurement (lb, kg, miles, etc), number for the measurement.

Need to be able to select from previously entered exercises. On the frontend this would populate a select drodpown element. I think this would be the enum required in the assignment.

Exercises can be edited and deleted.

Need a date object for when the exercise was last entered (indicating this was when the user last performed this exercise).

Need to be able to put together exercises into a complete workout. Workouts can be added, edited, and deleted. Can name workouts and can save workouts as a template.

Need to have a calender that shows days that had workouts. And you can click to view the workouts.
